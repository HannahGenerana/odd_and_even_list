# Exercise 10: Create a new list from two list using the following condition
# Create a new list from two list using the following condition
# Given two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

# pseudocode

# create a function to merge both different list in the result
def odd_and_even (first_list, second_list):

# create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
# take all odd numbers on the first list

# take all even numbers on the second list

# return the result of both list

# print the result
